This folder contains all the outside screens, which includes:
_login screen (done)
_sign-up screen (first version UI)
_get back password screen (first version UI)
All the screens is impletemented with expo react native.

The packages need to have to run those file are (will update when needed):
_expo-cli (install by using command npm install -g expo-cli)
_formik (install by using command expo install formik)
_styled-components (install by using command expo install styled-components)
_expo-constants (install by using command expo install expo-constants)
_date time picker pakage (install by using command expo install @react-native-community/datetimepicker)
_navigation pakages
(installby using these commands:
	+npm install @react-navigation/native
	+expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
	+npm install @react-navigation/native-stack
)

To run the project correctly with expo (until now):
_Create a project by using expo init <Project's name>
_Put outside_screens, components, navigator folder into the folder of the project which you was just created
_Put the image Logo.png in to the assets folder (will be generate automatically with your project)
(Not sure if these files can work with project created with react-native-cli)
